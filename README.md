- ... and more! (WIP)

## Structure
The solutions are organized by the language of the solution on HackerRank. Each solution is in a separate file named by the problem's title.

Example:
```
/
|-- python/
|   |-- problem1.py
|   |-- problem2.py
|-- scala/
|   |-- problem1.scala
|   |-- problem2.scala
```
